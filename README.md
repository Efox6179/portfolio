<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is Ethan Fox</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate frontend developer from Kansas City, MO</h3>

<p>This project is my personal web developement portfolio. This took me aproxamatley two weeks and by far is the hardest project ive ever worked on. I restarted from scratch 3 times becuase I wasnt happy with the layout and design. I finally landed on a simplisic yet elegant black with neon glow. I plan on contuinuing to add to this throughout my bootcamp and years down the road. I cannot wait to add JS elements and spice it up and getting it the way I truly want it. I'm a big fan of dark colored webpages however if I could change one thing it would be the amount of contrast or the lack there of rather. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!</p>
