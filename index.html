            <p class="intro-paragraph">I am a junior web developer based out of Kansas City, Mo. I was introduced to programming in high school however it didn't spark my interest until I got to the University of Kansas. I enrolled in the full-stack web development boot camp, and the rest is history. The problem-solving and intellectual stimulation is unmatched from anything else that I've done professionally.  </p>
