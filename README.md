<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, My name is Ethan Fox</h1>

<p>This is a random password generator in which the user has the options to pick and choose what characters are in their password. The user must first select the amount of characters that they want to use. The value is set as a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 128 long. If the user doesnt choose the a value between those two numbers they are returned and must restart. Once they choose their indended character choices and length of the password using java it randomly assembles a password in a random order. In the future id like to add more options including an option to add a specific phrase or keyword to be used in the password, as well as a copy and paste button for easy copying to the clipboard. I also think it would be interesting to experiment with adding the password to a google passwords folder so the user doesnt have to remember it and it will auto fill. </p>
